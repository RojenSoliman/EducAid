pg_dump -U postgres educaid > backup_before_archiving_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Run migration
psql -U postgres -d educaid -f sql/create_student_archiving_system.sql
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ALTER TABLE
CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX

### Step 4: Test Unarchiving

1. From Archived Students page
2. Click **View Details** on recently archived student
3. Click **Unarchive Student**
4. Confirm action
5. Verify:
