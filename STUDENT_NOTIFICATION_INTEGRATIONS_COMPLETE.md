### Primary Function:
```php
createStudentNotification(
    $connection,
    $student_id,      // TEXT type student ID
    $title,           // Notification title
    $message,         // Notification message
    $type,            // 'success', 'announcement', 'info', 'warning', etc.
    $priority,        // 'low', 'medium', 'high'
    $action_url       // URL for "View" button
);
```

### Bulk Function:
```php
createBulkStudentNotification(
    $connection,
    $title,
    $message,
    $type,
    $priority,
    $action_url,
    $student_ids = null  // null = all students, or array of specific IDs
);
```

## Architecture Notes

### Why No Document Validation Notifications?
The current system uses automated OCR validation for documents. There are no manual admin actions to approve/reject individual documents, so no notification integration point exists. The `documents_to_reupload` system is automated and triggers re-upload requests without explicit admin action.

### Why No Registration Rejection Notification?
When admin rejects a registration, the student record is completely deleted from the database (including their student_id). Since student_notifications table has a foreign key to student_id, we cannot store a notification for a deleted student. The system sends an email notification instead.

### Database Foreign Key Constraints
```sql
FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```
If a student is deleted, all their notifications are automatically deleted.

## Frontend Components

Students can view notifications via:
1. **Bell Icon** - `includes/student/bell_notifications.php` (dropdown in header)
2. **Notifications Page** - `modules/student/student_notifications.php` (full page view)

Both components are fully functional and integrated.

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Email Integration**: Send email copies of high-priority notifications
2. **Expiration System**: Use `expires_at` field for time-sensitive notifications
3. **Custom Actions**: Add more specific action URLs based on notification type
4. **Admin Panel**: Create admin interface to send custom notifications to students
5. **Notification Templates**: Create reusable templates for common notification types
