# Student Notification Integration - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Priority Areas for Student Notifications

Based on your application, here are the key areas where students need notifications:

### ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Announcements** - When admin posts announcement → All students notified

---

### 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY - Should implement these first

#### 1. **Student Registration Approval/Rejection**
**File**: `modules/admin/review_registrations.php`
- When admin approves registration → Student gets "approved" notification
- When admin rejects registration → Student gets "rejected" notification with reason

#### 2. **Document Validation**
**File**: `modules/admin/manage_applicants.php` or similar document review page
- When document is approved → Student gets "approved" notification
- When document is rejected → Student gets "rejected" notification (high priority, shows as modal)
- When document needs re-upload → Student gets "warning" notification

#### 3. **Application Status Changes**
**Files**: Multiple (`auto_approve_high_confidence.php`, `verify_students.php`, `view_documents.php`)
- When status changes from 'under_registration' → 'applicant' → Notify approval
- When status changes to 'active' → Notify activation
- When status changes to 'blacklisted' → Notify (critical)

---

### ⚡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Important but not critical

#### 4. **Schedule/Slot Assignment**
**File**: `modules/admin/manage_schedules.php`, `manage_slots.php`
- When student gets assigned a distribution schedule → Send schedule notification
- When schedule is updated → Send update notification

#### 5. **Distribution Status**
**File**: `modules/admin/scan_qr.php`
- When student status changes to 'given' (received distribution) → Send confirmation

---

### 📋 LOW PRIORITY - Nice to have

#### 6. **Profile Updates**
- When admin updates student profile → Notify student

#### 7. **System Maintenance**
- Before system downtime → Send announcement to all students

---

## 🚀 Implementation Order

I recommend implementing in this order for maximum impact:

### Phase 1: Registration & Approval (CRITICAL)
1. Registration approval/rejection in `review_registrations.php`
2. Application status changes in `verify_students.php`

### Phase 2: Documents (HIGH VALUE)
3. Document approval/rejection (needs to find exact file)
4. Document validation results

### Phase 3: Operations (NICE TO HAVE)
5. Schedule/slot assignment
6. Distribution confirmation
7. Profile updates

## 📝 Files to Modify

### Identified Key Files:
1. ✅ `modules/admin/manage_announcements.php` - DONE
2. 🔥 `modules/admin/review_registrations.php` - Registration approval/rejection
3. 🔥 `modules/admin/verify_students.php` - Status verification
4. 🔥 `modules/admin/view_documents.php` - Document approval
5. 🔥 `modules/admin/manage_applicants.php` - Document validation
6. ⚡ `modules/admin/manage_schedules.php` - Schedule assignment
7. ⚡ `modules/admin/scan_qr.php` - Distribution confirmation
8. 📋 `modules/admin/auto_approve_high_confidence.php` - Auto-approval
9. 📋 `modules/admin/blacklist_service.php` - Blacklist notification

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Template

For each file, the pattern is:

```php
// 1. Include the helper at the top
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/student_notification_helper.php';

// 2. After successful action, add notification
if ($action_successful) {
    // Your existing code...
    
    // Add notification
    createStudentNotification(
        $connection,
        $student_id,
        'Title Here',
        'Message here',
        'type',       // announcement|document|schedule|warning|error|success|system|info
        'priority',   // low|medium|high
        'action_url'  // Optional URL
    );
}
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

**I suggest we start with the TOP 3 most impactful:**

1. **Registration Approval/Rejection** (`review_registrations.php`)
   - Students immediately know if they're approved
   - Critical for user experience

2. **Document Validation** (`manage_applicants.php` or document review file)
   - Students know if documents are accepted/rejected
   - Prevents delays from waiting

3. **Application Status** (`verify_students.php`)
   - Students track their application progress
   - Reduces support requests

**Would you like me to implement these 3 first?**

I can:
- Add notifications to registration approval/rejection
- Add notifications to document validation
- Add notifications to status changes

Just let me know and I'll implement them one by one!
