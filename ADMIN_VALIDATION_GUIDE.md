## Tips for Admins

1. **Always check both confidence scores AND visual inspection**
2. **High confidence doesn't guarantee authenticity** - manually verify suspicious documents
3. **Low confidence doesn't always mean fake** - poor photo quality can cause low scores
4. **Look for consistency** - if one document passes but another fails, investigate
5. **Use found text snippets** - verify that extracted text matches what you see in the document
6. **Trust your judgment** - OCR is a tool, not the final decision maker

---

## Accessing Validation Details

1. Go to **Manage Applicants** page
2. Find the applicant you want to review
3. Look for document rows in the applicant's detail section
4. Click **"View Validation"** button next to any document
5. Modal opens showing all validation checks with confidence scores
6. Review checks and make approval decision

## Troubleshooting

**"Detailed verification checks are not available for this document type"**
- Document was uploaded before validation system was implemented
- Request student to reupload the document
- Or manually review the document without validation data

**Some checks show 0% confidence**
- Information not found in document (e.g., no middle name on ID)
- OCR failed to extract that specific field
- Review the actual document to verify

**All checks passed but document looks suspicious**
- Validation passed doesn't mean document is authentic
- Always perform visual inspection
- Check for signs of tampering, photo manipulation, or fake documents
- When in doubt, request additional verification
