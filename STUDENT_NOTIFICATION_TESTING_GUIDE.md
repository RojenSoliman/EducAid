## Test Student Credentials

Create test student accounts with different statuses:

2. **Test Student 2**: applicant â†’ Test verification
3. **Test Student 3**: active â†’ Test announcements & distribution

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Bell icon not showing
**Solution**: Check that `bell_notifications.php` is included in `student_header.php`

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
**Solutions**:
1. Check database connection in helper function
2. Verify student_id is TEXT type (not integer)
3. Check student_notifications table exists
4. Verify foreign key constraint is valid

### Issue: Unread count not updating
**Solution**: Check JavaScript AJAX calls in bell_notifications.php

### Issue: "Mark All as Read" not working
**Solution**: Check API endpoint at `api/student/mark_all_notifications_read.php`

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, remove these lines from each file:

### review_registrations.php (Line 3):
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/student_notification_helper.php';
```

### manage_applicants.php (After database include):
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/student_notification_helper.php';
```

### auto_approve_high_confidence.php (Line 3):
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/student_notification_helper.php';
```

### scan_qr.php (Line 4):
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../includes/student_notification_helper.php';
```

And comment out all `createStudentNotification()` calls.
