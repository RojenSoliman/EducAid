# Slot Auto-Close Implementation

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Purpose:** Automatically close signup slots when distribution is completed

---

## Overview

When an admin clicks "Complete Distribution" in the QR Scanner page, the system now automatically closes all active signup slots. This prevents new student registrations after a distribution cycle has been finalized.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Auto-Close Slots on Distribution Completion

**File:** `modules/admin/scan_qr.php`  
**Lines:** ~256-271

**What It Does:**
- After successfully creating/updating a distribution snapshot
- Automatically executes: `UPDATE signup_slots SET is_active = FALSE WHERE is_active = TRUE`
- Closes all active slots to prevent new registrations
- Logs the number of slots closed
- Adds notification to success message

**Code:**
```php
if ($snapshot_result) {
    // AUTO-CLOSE ACTIVE SLOTS when distribution is completed
    // This prevents new registrations after distribution is finalized
    $close_slots_query = "UPDATE signup_slots SET is_active = FALSE WHERE is_active = TRUE";
    $close_slots_result = pg_query($connection, $close_slots_query);
    
    if ($close_slots_result) {
        $closed_slots_count = pg_affected_rows($close_slots_result);
        error_log("Auto-closed $closed_slots_count active slot(s) after distribution completion");
    } else {
        error_log("Warning: Failed to auto-close slots: " . pg_last_error($connection));
    }
    
    pg_query($connection, "COMMIT");
    $action_type = $snapshot_exists ? 'updated' : 'created';
    $slot_message = ($closed_slots_count > 0) ? " Active signup slots have been automatically closed." : "";
    $_SESSION['success_message'] = "Distribution snapshot $action_type successfully! Recorded $total_students students for " . 
        trim($academic_year . ' ' . ($semester ?? '')) . ". You can now proceed to End Distribution when ready." . $slot_message;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Past Slot Display with Participants

**File:** `modules/admin/manage_slots.php`  
**Lines:** ~858-976

**What It Does:**
- Shows compact list of all participants for each past slot
- Displays participant name, application date, and status
- Color-coded status badges (Pending, Approved, Verified, Distributed)
- Scrollable table for slots with many participants
- Preserves participant data even after slot is deleted

**Features:**
- **Compact View:** Accordion-based display saves screen space
- **Participant Table:** Shows who registered for each slot
- **Status Tracking:** Visual badges show progression (Pending → Approved → Verified → Distributed)
- **Search-Friendly:** Can see exactly who got into which slot
- **Safe Delete:** Deleting a slot record doesn't delete student data

**Display Includes:**
- Slot capacity (e.g., "45 / 50 slots used")
- Semester and Academic Year
- Application date for each student
- Current status of each student
- Total participants count

---

## User Flow

### Before Distribution Completion

1. **Admin Creates Slot**
   - Sets capacity (e.g., 50 slots)
   - Slot is marked as `is_active = TRUE`
   - Students can register

2. **Students Register**
   - Fill out registration forms
   - Assigned to active slot
   - Status changes: `under_registration` → `applicant` (when approved)

3. **Admin Manages Applicants**
   - Reviews pending registrations
   - Approves/rejects students
   - Slot shows current usage (e.g., "32 / 50 slots used")

### Distribution Completion

4. **Admin Clicks "Complete Distribution"**
   - In QR Scanner page after scanning students
   - Creates distribution snapshot
   - **Automatically closes active slots** ✨
   - Success message shows: "Active signup slots have been automatically closed."

### After Distribution Completion

5. **Slot Becomes "Past Release"**
   - Moves to "Past Releases" section
   - Shows final participant count
   - Can expand to see full participant list
   - Slot cannot accept new registrations

6. **View Participants**
   - Click on past slot to expand
   - See table of all participants:
     - Name
     - Application date
     - Current status (Pending/Approved/Verified/Distributed)
   - Export or review for records

## Example Scenario

### Scenario: 2025-2026 1st Semester Distribution

**Step 1: Create Slot**
```
Semester: 1st Semester
Academic Year: 2025-2026
Capacity: 50 slots
Status: Active (is_active = TRUE)
```

**Step 2: Students Register**
```
Student 1: Dela Cruz, Juan - Oct 15, 2025 - Status: Approved
Student 2: Santos, Maria - Oct 16, 2025 - Status: Approved
Student 3: Reyes, Pedro - Oct 17, 2025 - Status: Pending
...
Total: 32 students registered
```

**Step 3: Admin Completes Distribution**
```
Action: Click "Complete Distribution" in QR Scanner
Result:
  ✓ Distribution snapshot created
  ✓ Slot automatically closed (is_active = FALSE)
  ✓ Message: "Active signup slots have been automatically closed."
```

**Step 4: View Past Slot**
```
Past Releases Section:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Error Handling

### If Slot Auto-Close Fails

**Symptom:** Slot remains active after distribution completion

**Check Logs:**
```
Error: Warning: Failed to auto-close slots: [error message]
```

**Manual Fix:**
```sql
UPDATE signup_slots SET is_active = FALSE 
WHERE is_active = TRUE 
AND semester = '1st Semester' 
AND academic_year = '2025-2026';
```

**Prevention:** Already implemented with error logging

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Slot Metrics Dashboard**
   - Utilization rate per slot (e.g., "64% capacity used")
   - Average time between slot creation and filling
   - Most popular registration days

2. **Export Participant Lists**
   - Download CSV of slot participants
   - Include all student details
   - Filter by status

3. **Slot Comparison**
   - Compare participant counts across semesters
   - Identify trends (growing/shrinking program)
   - Capacity planning recommendations

4. **Notification to Students**
   - Email/SMS when slot closes
   - "Registration window has ended" message
   - Link to check application status

---

## Conclusion

The slot auto-close feature ensures a clean separation between distribution cycles. When an admin completes a distribution, signup slots automatically close to prevent confusion and maintain data integrity. Past slots remain accessible for historical reference with a compact, user-friendly participant view.

**Key Takeaway:** Distribution completion now handles both student data archival AND slot closure automatically, reducing manual steps and preventing registration errors.
