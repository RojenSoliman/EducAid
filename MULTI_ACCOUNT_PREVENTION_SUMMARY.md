## üéØ System Features

### Prevention Layers

#### Layer 1: Real-Time Detection
- Checks database as user types
- Shows immediate feedback (available/duplicate)
- Blocks navigation if duplicate found

#### Layer 2: Identity Matching
- Cross-references name and birthdate
- Detects same person re-registering
- Different messages for:
  - Your existing account
  - Someone else's ID

#### Layer 3: Database Constraints
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_school_student_id 
ON students(university_id, school_student_id);
```

#### Layer 4: Final Validation
- Double-checks before INSERT
- Uses database function
- Prevents race conditions

#### Layer 5: Audit Trail
- Every action logged
- IP address tracked
- Timestamp recorded
- Cannot be deleted

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Normal Registration
- [ ] Select university
- [ ] Enter new school student ID (e.g., `2024-TEST001`)
- [ ] Should show green "Available" message
- [ ] Next button should be enabled
- [ ] Can proceed to next step

### Test 2: Duplicate Detection - Same Person
- [ ] Complete first registration with school ID `2024-DUP001`
- [ ] Start new registration with SAME name, birthdate
- [ ] Enter school ID `2024-DUP001` again
- [ ] Should show red "Your existing account" message
- [ ] Should show email/mobile hints
- [ ] Next button should be disabled

### Test 3: Duplicate Detection - Different Person
- [ ] Have existing account (Juan, 2024-DUP002)
- [ ] Start new registration with DIFFERENT name (Maria)
- [ ] Enter school ID `2024-DUP002`
- [ ] Should show red "Belongs to another person" message
- [ ] Next button should be disabled

### Test 4: University Switching
- [ ] Select University A
- [ ] Enter school ID `2024-SWITCH001`
- [ ] Change to University B
- [ ] Same ID should re-check against University B
- [ ] Should work independently per university

### Test 5: Database Trigger
- [ ] Complete registration with school ID
- [ ] Check tracking table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM school_student_ids WHERE school_student_id = 'YOUR-ID';
```
- [ ] Should have entry with correct university_id
- [ ] Check audit log:
```sql
SELECT * FROM school_student_id_audit WHERE school_student_id = 'YOUR-ID';
```
- [ ] Should have registration entry with IP address

## üìä Admin Queries

### View All Duplicates
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_school_student_id_duplicates;
```

### Check Specific School ID
```sql
SELECT * FROM check_duplicate_school_student_id(1, '2024-12345');
```

### Recent Registrations
```sql
SELECT * FROM school_student_id_audit 
WHERE action = 'register' 
ORDER BY performed_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### Registrations per University
```sql
SELECT u.name, COUNT(*) as total
FROM school_student_ids ssi
JOIN universities u ON ssi.university_id = u.university_id
WHERE ssi.status = 'active'
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY total DESC;
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Duplicate check not working

**Check 1: Function exists**
```sql
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name = 'check_duplicate_school_student_id';
```

**Check 2: AJAX handler**
```javascript
// Browser console
console.log(typeof checkSchoolStudentIdDuplicate);
// Should output: "function"
```

**Check 3: Network request**
```javascript
// Browser Network tab (F12)
// Look for POST request with check_school_student_id parameter
```

### Issue: Trigger not firing

**Check trigger:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_track_school_student_id';
```

**Test manually:**
```sql
-- This should automatically create entries in tracking tables
INSERT INTO students (
    student_id, municipality_id, first_name, last_name,
    university_id, school_student_id, email, mobile,
    password, sex, bdate
) VALUES (
    'TEST-999', 1, 'Test', 'User', 1, 'TRIGGER-TEST-001',
    'test@test.com', '09123456789', 'password', 'Male', '2000-01-01'
);

-- Check if tracked
SELECT * FROM school_student_ids WHERE school_student_id = 'TRIGGER-TEST-001';

-- Cleanup
DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 'TEST-999';
```

## üéì Key Concepts

### Dual ID System
- **student_id**: System-generated (e.g., `GENSAN-2024-1-ABC123`)
  - Unique across entire system
  - Used for all internal operations
  
- **school_student_id**: School-issued (e.g., `2024-12345`)
  - Unique per university
  - Entered by student
  - Verified against ID picture

### Why Per-University Uniqueness?
Different universities can have overlapping student ID formats:
- LPU Cavite: `2024-12345`
- De La Salle: `2024-12345` (different student)

The system allows this but prevents the SAME school ID being used twice in the SAME university.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run installation script or SQL manually
2. ‚úÖ Test duplicate detection with sample data
3. ‚úÖ Complete full registration flow test
4. ‚úÖ Check audit logs are populating
5. ‚úÖ Verify triggers are working
6. ‚úÖ Test with multiple universities
7. ‚úÖ Document any edge cases found

## üìû Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Will this break existing registrations?**
A: No. The schema adds new columns/tables without modifying existing data.

**Q: What about students already registered?**
A: They won't have school_student_id initially. On next login or update, they can add it.

**Q: Can admin bypass duplicate check?**
A: Database constraints will still prevent duplicates. Manual override requires SQL access.

**Q: How to handle transfers?**
A: Student transfers = new university = new school_student_id = new system account.
