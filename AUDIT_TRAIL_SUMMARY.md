## 🎯 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Logging System
- **18 fields** per audit entry including user info, event details, IP address, user agent, old/new values (JSON), metadata
- **8 database indexes** for fast queries
- **3 helper views** for common queries
- **30+ event types** across 8 categories
- Automatic IP address detection (proxy-aware)
- Session ID tracking for correlation

### ✅ Event Categories Tracked
1. **Authentication** - Login/logout for admin and students
2. **Slot Management** - Opening/closing registration slots
3. **Applicant Management** - Approvals, rejections, verifications
4. **Payroll** - Number generation and changes
5. **Schedule** - Creation, publication, deletion
6. **Profile** - Email/password changes
7. **Distribution** - Lifecycle events
8. **System** - Configuration and maintenance

### ✅ Web Interface (Super Admin Only)
- **Statistics Dashboard** - 24-hour activity summary with 4 key metrics
- **Advanced Filters:**
  - Search by description/event/username
  - Filter by user type (Admin/Student/System)
  - Filter by event category
  - Filter by status (success/failure/warning)
  - Filter by username (partial match)
  - Filter by date range
  - Filter by IP address
- **Event Details Modal** - View complete event information with JSON formatting
- **CSV Export** - Download filtered results
- **Pagination** - 50 records per page with navigation
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## 🔒 Security & Access Control

- **Super Admin Only** - Sub-admins cannot access audit logs
- **Read-only Interface** - Audit logs cannot be edited or deleted from UI
- **IP Tracking** - Every action includes source IP address
- **Session Correlation** - Track actions across session lifecycle
- **Tamper Detection** - JSONB fields preserve exact state changes

## 📊 What Gets Logged

### Already Integrated ✅
- ✅ Admin login/logout
- ✅ Student login/logout
- ✅ Failed login attempts
- ✅ Slot opened/closed
- ✅ Applicant rejected
- ✅ Schedule created
- ✅ Schedule published
- ✅ Schedule cleared

### Easy to Add (methods available):
- Email changes (`logEmailChanged`)
- Password changes (`logPasswordChanged`)
- Payroll generation (`logPayrollGenerated`)
- Payroll number changes (`logPayrollNumberChanged`)
- Applicant approvals (`logApplicantApproved`)
- Applicant verification (`logApplicantVerified`)
- Distribution lifecycle events (`logDistributionStarted`, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Installation:
```bash
# 1. Run SQL migration
psql -U postgres -d educaid_db -f sql/create_audit_trail.sql

# 2. Verify installation
psql -U postgres -d educaid_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_logs;"

# 3. Access as super admin
# Navigate to: Audit Trail in sidebar
```

### Query Examples:
```sql
-- Recent activity
SELECT * FROM v_recent_admin_activity LIMIT 20;

-- Failed logins (24h)
SELECT * FROM v_failed_logins 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Specific user's actions
SELECT event_type, action_description, created_at 
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE username = 'admin_username' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Actions by category
SELECT event_category, COUNT(*) 
FROM audit_logs 
GROUP BY event_category;
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Included:
- 8 specialized indexes for common queries
- Composite indexes for filtered date queries
- JSONB for efficient JSON storage/querying
- Pagination (50 records per page)
- Parameterized queries (SQL injection safe)

### Expected Performance:
- **10,000 events**: Instant queries
- **100,000 events**: Fast queries (<100ms)
- **1,000,000+ events**: May need archiving

### Maintenance Plan:
```sql
-- Archive logs older than 1 year (run monthly)
INSERT INTO audit_logs_archive
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';

DELETE FROM audit_logs
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Vacuum and analyze
VACUUM ANALYZE audit_logs;
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

   - 🟢 Green = Success
   - 🔴 Red = Failure
   - 🟡 Yellow = Warning

2. **User type indicators**:
   - 🔵 Blue = Admin
   - 🟢 Green = Student
   - ⚪ Gray = System

3. **Hover effects** on table rows
4. **Responsive design** for mobile/tablet
5. **Modal details view** with syntax-highlighted JSON
6. **Quick statistics** cards at top
7. **Clear filters** button for easy reset

## 🔧 Extending the System

### To log a new event type:

```php
// 1. Use existing method
$auditLogger->logEvent(
    'custom_event_type',
    'custom_category',
    'Description of what happened',
    [
        'user_id' => $userId,
        'user_type' => 'admin',
        'username' => $username,
        'status' => 'success',
        'metadata' => ['key' => 'value']
    ]
);

// 2. Or create specialized method in AuditLogger.php
public function logCustomAction($adminId, $adminUsername, $data) {
    return $this->logEvent(
        'custom_action',
        'custom_category',
        "Description with {$data}",
        [
            'user_id' => $adminId,
            'user_type' => 'admin',
            'username' => $adminUsername,
            'new_values' => $data
        ]
    );
}
```
